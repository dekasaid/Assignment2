Multi-Platform Interactions

Overview of what you did
   a) Interacting with nature objects (flower, insects, plants)
   b) I had some objects animate when selected (if you click on a flower, it will increase scale and rotate while on mouse hover/click)
   c) added some sounds to some objects when on click, sound will play 

What was challenging
(Overall, I had some trouble with ideas on how i would create an interactive platform with a-frame. I just had different objects do diffrent things rather than having something more structred) 
    a) having the camera to work on mobile there's limited features that work when using it on mobile (you can move forward or rotate left or right) 
    b) using javascript to implement components in some objects (I wanted to have some objects change state if clicked, i.e if you clicked on a butterfly it would change to a bee or something else)
    c) having more control with the object + sounds 


What went well 
    a) object selection, having the mouse (cursor) interact with objects
    b) change of object's attribute 
    c) mouse/cursor parent on the camera and be manipulated as a pointer
    d) have object text labeled when on hover/click, change its size/position
